    <p>Hey buddy! It seems that you've found a marvellous website( well, not yet (⌐■_■)).</p>
    <p>I'm a rookie programmer from the beautiful country - <i><b>People's Republic of China</b></i>.</p> 
    <p>My mother tongue is Chinese, so please forgive my English grammatical errors.</p>
    <p>I'd be very glad if you can correct my mistakes(Especially in British English).</p>
    <p>Also, help you to improve your Chinese would be my honour. You can ask me about my mysterious motherland.</p>
    <p>You can connect me through my emails.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:xuhaocong-cn@outlook.com">xuhaocong-cn@outlook.com</a></li>
        <p>or</p>
        <li><a href="mailto:hackettxu@gmail.com">hackettxu@gmail.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I don't respond to your emails in time, please send an issue to my 
        <a href="https://github.com/HackettHsu/HackettHsu.github.io">Github</a> page.</p>
    <p>You can also visit my <a href="https://me.csdn.net/HACKETTx">Chinese blog</a> (powered by CSDN.net). </p>
    <p>Of course, it's written in Chinese. ヾ(•ω•`)o</p>
